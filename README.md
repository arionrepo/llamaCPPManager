# llamaCPPManager

Toolkit for managing local `llama-server` instances (from llama.cpp) on macOS.

## Project Goals
- Provide a macOS-friendly launcher to start/stop/monitor multiple llama.cpp model services.
- Offer simple visibility into model status, ports, and logs.
- Package tooling so it can be launched from the Applications folder with an icon.

See `docs/requirements.md` for the detailed requirements backlog.
